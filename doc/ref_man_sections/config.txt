CONFIGURATION AND SUPPORT FILES

The TEMPO environment variable must point to a directory containing
configuration file tempo.cfg.  In other words, the configuration file
is $TEMPO/tempo.cfg.

Entries in tempo.cfg are free-format, with the form 'keyword value', where
value is a directory or file name as appropriate.  Keywords are
case-insensitive, although file names are not.

tempo.cfg keywords:

CLKDIR      Directory containing clock offset files
OBS_NIST    Offsets between observatory clock and UTC(NIST)
NIST_UTC    Offsets between UTC(NIST) and UTC
NIST_TT     Offsets between UTC(NIST) and TT(BIPM)
NIST_PTB    Offsets between UTC(NIST) and UTC(PTB)
NIST_AT1    Offsets between UTC(NIST) and AT1
UT1         Offsets between UTC and UT1

EPHDIR      Directory containing ephemeris files
TDBFILE     Offsets between TDB and TT
EPHFILE     Solar system ephemeris file (from JPL distribution).  
            There may be up to five EPHFILE entries.  
            Optional flags:
                --endian=little or --endian=big 
                       default is big endian
                --eph=<ephname> where typical <ephname> is DE200, DE405, etc.
                       default is first five characters of ephemeris name
                               

PARDIR      Directory containing <psrname>.par files for prediction mode
TZDIR       Directory containing 'tz.in' control file for prediction mode
TZTOT       Name (with absolute path) of parameter file for prediction mode
            (Used only in 'old-format' mode.)

OBSYS       Name (with absolute path) of observatory coordinate file
